# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Plan File Location

When creating plans in plan mode, always save them to the `plans/` directory in this project.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use the default three-random-words naming convention. Instead, always name plan files with a clear, descriptive name that reflects the plan's purpose (e.g., `plans/add_user_authentication.md`, `plans/refactor_database_layer.md`, `plans/fix_video_encoding_bug.md`).

## Committing Plans

When committing implementation work, include any relevant plan files from `plans/` in the commit. Plans serve as documentation of the design decisions and should be versioned alongside the code they describe.
